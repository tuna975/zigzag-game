Hi, there this is a readme file to get your game working through the application rather than from the console.

For the game to work, you must have Unity Installed on your Mac/Windows.
You can download Unity from the given link -> https://unity.com/download

For the scripts, you must have Visual Studio Community 
Download Link for Visual Studio Community -> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

Now download all the source files from the repository 

Now to run the game as an application
 - Go to the assets folder
 - Run the "main" application which would be a unity scene file.
 - Now the Unity GUI will open considering you have downloaded Unity on your Mac/Windows
 - Now go to the build settings of the project which you can find in the top left corner of the GUI under the section "file".
 - Now select the scene and tap on the build settings.
 - Build according to your OS of the system
 - Choose the file location in which you want to build the app
 - Tap on Build and Run
 - Wait for some time
 - Voila, Enjoy the Game

Make sure to have the latest version of Unity for the build Process.

Added a new mini-game TIC TAC TOE in the source file, which can be directly runned from the Visual Studio Comuunity IDE. Enjoy :)
